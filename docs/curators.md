## How to Create a Strategy on PWN
Curating a strategy on PWN involves several key steps. Follow this guide to successfully set up and publish your strategy:

- Step 1: Start by connecting a wallet associated with the curator address provided in the curator form. (If you're not a curator yet, you can apply by filling out this Google form.)

- Step 3: Name and Describe the Strategy
Begin by giving your strategy a meaningful name and adding a description. This is done in the top-left section of the interface, where you can clearly outline the purpose and goals of your strategy.

- Step 4: Define the Duration
Set the duration, which represents the time borrowers will have to repay their loans. This parameter determines how long each loan will run before repayment is due.

- Step 5: Set the Expiration
Configure the offer expiration, which defines how long an unused offer will remain pending before it expires. This acts as a safety mechanism to prevent outdated offers from remaining on the platform.

Now, it's time to choose credit and collateral for the strategy.
Here's how:
