# Borrowing on PWN

### Borrowing on PWN is easy as ABC.&#x20;

### Pick your collateral and borrowed asset, choose your terms, post your borrowing offer and get funded.&#x20;

### Don't worry about liquidation and volatility. Once set, the terms don't change, and the only way to lose your collateral is by missing the repayment deadline.
